# Cazan documentation

Cazan's duty is to help you to build your games in browsers, using ``<canvas>``.

But it's not a simple API built on top of the Javascript DOM API. Cazan provides a drawing system, with FPS handling and optimization, audios and videos support, and lots of utilities more!

Cazan is not alone! You can be improved by Cazanw. Cazanw is a subproject whose aim to speed up calculations, for example those for collisions, among others, thanks to WASM.

## Drawing system

The basic shapes are already available and implemented by Cazan (like Rectangle, Line, Circle,...), but you can use the API to build your own shapes.

You can customize the styles of the shapes and even display images on the shapes that admit it.

You don't have to focus on how to save your shapes for the next frame, because Cazan does it automatically.

## FPS handling

You can manually set a number of FPS for your game, but if the user's screen is not good enough for your game Cazan will automatically adapt the game to the user's screen.

## Multimedia support

Cazan's Multimedia API helps you to include audios and videos in your game only in JavaScript! You don't have to include manually your videos and audios anymore!

## Utilities

...

### Keyboard events

You can add events on keyboard events simply with Cazan's Event API.

### Popups

Cazan implements a popups system for simplifying the interactions between the user and the game. With only one line of code you can ask a question to the user or tell him about an error...
